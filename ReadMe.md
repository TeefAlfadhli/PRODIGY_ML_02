# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**. The goal is to categorize customers into distinct groups to help businesses understand their buying behavior and optimize marketing strategies.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and removing outliers.
- **Optimal Cluster Selection**: Using the **Elbow Method** to determine the best number of clusters.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applying unsupervised learning to identify customer segments.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize and interpret customer groups.
- **Meaningful Cluster Naming**: Assigning intuitive names to each cluster based on analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Identified Customer Segments
After applying **K-Means clustering**, the following **customer groups** were identified:

1. **Luxury Shoppers**: High income, high spending.
2. **Budget-Conscious Shoppers**: Low income, low spending.
3. **Impulsive Buyers**: Low income, high spending.
4. **Cautious High-Income Shoppers**: High income, low spending.
5. **Moderate Spenders**: Mid-income, moderate spending.

## ðŸ“„ Notebook
The complete analysis and clustering implementation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook:
- **CustomerClustering.ipynb**

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **scikit-learn** (Machine Learning - K-Means Clustering)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
